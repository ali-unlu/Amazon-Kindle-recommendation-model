# Amazon Kindle features and recommendation model
In this short exercise, I will demonstrate how you can create a model for product recommendation. The main aim is to find the important features of the reviews that lead people to make a recommendation. In other terms, it will also show us what are the strengths and weakness of the product, what features make people like or dislike it. This analysis can be also considered a sentiment analysis but for its design, it is a classic text classification model. 

I also analyzed the same data from sentiment analyis perspective, using Bing and AFINN dictionaries. If you would like to see my previous post, please check out [this page.](https://github.com/ali-unlu/Amazon-product-review) 

Basically, this analysis includes. 
1. Tokenization. 
2. Tidy style model and workflow creation. 
3. Tunning. 
4. Identifying the predictor importance. 
5. Model validation.
